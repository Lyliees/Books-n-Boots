        Sports lesson is a free part of English clubs, and I encourage all my students to participate in this class. They have the opportunity to use English in a completely new and safe environment while staying healthy and fit. They might be surprised at how fun English can be.
        I welcome everyone - boys, girls, big and small.
        We try out various sports such as rugby, cricket, Australian football, and more.
