<div class="grade-english">
    <h1>G’day,</h1>
</div>

<div class="about-jan">
    <p class="about-1">
        My name is Jan Novák. Not your typical Aussie name is it? Well, that’s because I am a current dual-citizen of both
        Australia and the Czech Republic. I spent the first 25 years of my life in Australia until I moved to Czech Republic
        in 2014 to become an English teacher. 
    </p>

    <p class="about-2">
            I began my teaching journey here in the Czech Republic at the beginning of
        2014. In that time I have worked for the same private school in all areas of English language learning. I began
        teaching in the preschool where I learnt how to accomodate to the needs of our youngest learners. For one school
        year I worked in the role of Head Teacher where I oversaw all that is involved in the running of a school. From
        there I moved to teaching private lessons to small groups and one to one lessons. 
    </p>

    <p class="about-3">
        In the last three years my focus
        has shifted to teaching within the state school system overseeing the implementation of a new learning program CLIL
        (Content Language Intergrated Learning)
    </p>

<h2>My qualifications include:</h2>

<ul class="list">
    <li>Bachelor of Arts: Duel majoring in Political Science and English Literature</li>
    <li>TESOL Certificate: Teaching English as a Second Language</li>
    <li>TESOL Certificate: Young Learners</li>
    <li>TESOL Certificate: Business English</li>
    <li>Osvědčení: Studium Pedagogiky</li>
    <li>Osvědčení: Asistenta Pedagoga</li>
</ul>

<p class="about-4">
    I believe my many years experience and real world skills have made it possible to offer the 
    highest quality education available.
</p>

<p class="about-5">As you can see from the photos sports and the healthy development of young children is important to me. 
    Physical health almost always transfers to success in all areas in life. That is why throughout 
    my life I have been a competitive sportsman and getting out in nature to enjoy more extreme sports as well. 
    Now in the Czech Republic I am a member of the Czech National Australian Football team that competes 
    every year in the European Championships. 
    I also play Rugby for ARC Iuridica in the Czech first division. 
</p>
    
<p class="about-6">
    I hope together we can build healthy bodies and healthy minds.
